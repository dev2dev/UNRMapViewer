pBase is the point index where U and V are = to 0
vTextureU is the (index of the) vector pointing in the direction of the textures U coord
vTextureV is the (index of the) vector pointing in the direction of the textures V coord

calc which point is pBase
calc the displacement of every other vertex from that point
dot product by the texU and texV to get the U and V for that point
add panU and panV to get the final tex coord
